### Hi, I’m Jason 👋

I work at the intersection of ecommerce, product, and technology.

Over the past 10+ years, I’ve built, operated, and evolved commerce businesses — from co-owning and scaling a multi-channel retail brand to partnering with teams on complex commerce builds, integrations, and optimization work. My experience spans storefronts, checkout and conversion, loyalty and retention, product data, and fulfillment systems.

I’m most comfortable solving real problems that sit between code, operations, and customer experience.
